# PyRipple
This was created for Fall 2019 CS 201 at Duke, as the optional P8 Create project, for an extra point on the final exam. My submission is here: https://youtu.be/UezBdtUaC6s 

The prompt was to create something that reminded us of CS 201 in more than 15 minutes and fewer than 15 hours.

Just click to create ripples in the pond.

This was written in Python 3.7 using PyGame.
